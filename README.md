## Graph using RStudio
**The A/I Graph**
![The-A:I-Graph](https://github.com/aommoaGitHub/ComponentDependency/blob/master/images/The-A:I-Graph.png "The-A:I-Graph")
**Histogram of the normalized distance**
![Hist-Normailized-Distance](https://github.com/aommoaGitHub/ComponentDependency/blob/master/images/Hist-Normalized-Distance.png "Hist-Normailized-Distance")

From the A/I Graph, it shows that most of them are not close to the main sequence. And from histogram of normalized distance, show that mostly of them have high distance from the main sequence, too.
